## Meeting 3:

&rarr; Organize repo by directories

&rarr; Finish IAM Admin Check

&rarr; Minimize false positives by port scanning the public ec2 instance if it is actually publicly accessible

&rarr; Utilize the automatic requirements.txt installation of dependencies instead of lambda layers of the discord lambda module (check docs)

&rarr; POST ABOUT THE DaC, MENTION THE PROJECT

### Next Meeting:
 Set a sub-goal: Work through this stuff, get at least two done

 - Worked on getting these started:

    - I organized the Repo by file type and order of operation

    - Set up the IAM python code, based it on the EC2 code from before as a template

    - Placed potential ways to prevent false positives in the ec2 python code
    
    - Made the requirements.txt, still needs the pip install stuff (DOWN WITH THE LOCAL INSTALLATIONS)

    - Posted about the DaC
