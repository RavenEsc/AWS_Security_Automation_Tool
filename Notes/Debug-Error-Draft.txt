    with module.lambda_layer_discord.data.
        Could not locate source_path

            set source_path from "\Discor.." to "Discor.."
2
    with module.lambda_s3.aws_lambda_event_source_mapping.
        "event_source_arn" must be specified
            Changed ".arn" to ".event_source_arn"
3
    with module.lambda_s3.aws_lambda_event_source_mapping.
        "self_managed_event_source" must be specified
            Removed input: starting position (not neant for SQS
            events)
